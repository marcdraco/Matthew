High-performance headphone amplifier based on the NE5532DR

This is, I hope the last main revision for this project (third one is a charm) after I found I'd specificied the wrong value on the JLCPCB ordering page resulting in 100K resistors being replaced by 1 ohm ... and the Magic Smoke came without the genie... Oh well. This is why I ask everyone to wait until I've gotten final boards back and tested them before you spend your money on my mistakes. I wish I never made a mistake but you know, it's how we learn.
